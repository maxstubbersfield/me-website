<h1>Privacy Policy for the use of the Me App</h1>
<h6>(Version 1.0, October 2021)</h6>
<p>The Me App (&quot;Me&quot; / &quot;the App&quot;) is a product of the Me GbR (“We”/ “Us”). It offers you the opportunity to self-reflect on your life situation through journaling, tracking psychological metrics and completing self-reflection exercises. Additionally the self-reflection &amp; personality development is fostered by psychoeducational learning content that is both provided by the Me GbR and third party content partners. The information that is gathered by that and by journaling is stored in your profile within the Me App.</p>
<p>The privacy and security of your data is of high importance to us, which is why your journaling data is stored exclusively on your smartphone and is not accessible to us or third parties.</p>
<p>All Data is collected, processed and stored in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 released on april 27th 2016 (“GDPR”).</p>
<p>The processing of your data serves exclusively the purpose of journaling and self-reflection. The Me App does not provide medical or psychotherapeutic consultation. It does not replace the consultation of a trained clinician or professional psychotherapist. Since the Me GbR does not give medical advice within the scope of the Me App it is not bound to medical confidentiality.</p>

<h2>§ 2 Local Data Processing</h2>
<p>Your personal data, including the information that you enter into the Me App during journaling and completing self-reflection exercises, will be processed and stored encrypted and exclusively locally on your smartphone. It is not sent to a remote server.</p>
<p>This way your personal data can not be seen, analysed or shared by anyone except yourself or any other person that has access to your smartphone and holds your login credentials to the Me App. That is why you should make sure that your smartphone is not compromised in any way, including not providing root access to anyone (i.e. “jailbreaking”). Additionally you should not share your login credentials with anyone and store them at a secure location.</p>

<ul>
<li>Terms and Conditions</li>

</ul>
<p>You can revoke those consents at any time with effect for the future in the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the app. Upon revocation or discontinuation of any of those consents, the right to use the Me App shall cease to exist. However, the legality of the storage of data based on your consent until revocation is not affected by this.</p>

<ul>
<li>your phone’s manufacturer</li>

<h2>§ 6 Backup of your data</h2>
<h6>Involved categories of personal data:</h6>
<p>The Me App offers the functionality to backup the data that you enter into the app during journaling and completing self-reflection exercises. During this data processing a copy of your local database is created and encrypted. The app lets you export this encrypted backup to a third party data storage location of your choice. The encryption of the backup can only be decrypted with the “Recovery Key” that is unique to your user profile and provided to you in the “Settings” section of the Me App.</p>
<h6>Usage of your personal data:</h6>
<p>Since your data is processed and stored encrypted exclusively locally on your smartphone and is not sent to a remote server, your data can not be restored in the event of your smartphone being not functional or available to you anymore. Should you change your smartphone an exported and encrypted backup of your data enables you to transfer your data onto your new smartphone.</p>
<h6>Legal basis:</h6>
<p>The legal basis for this data processing is the fulfillment of our contract with you for the use of the Me App.</p>
<h6>Duration of storage:</h6>
<p>You alone decide how long the backup of your data will be stored in the third party data storage location of your choice. You can delete it at any time.</p>
<h6>Involved third parties:</h6>
<p>You alone select the third party data storage location to which you export the encrypted backup of your data. While your encrypted data is stored there, it can not be accessed by the provider of the data storage location without the “Recovery Key” that you should store at another safe location outside of the Me App.</p>
<h2>§ 7 Your rights in relation to your data</h2>
