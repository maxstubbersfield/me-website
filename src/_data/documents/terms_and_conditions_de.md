## Liability for contents

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own contents on these pages according to section 7 para.1 TMG and general laws. According to sections 8 to 10 TMG we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored information from third parties or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.‍

Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. If we become aware of any such legal infringements, we will remove the content in question immediately.

## Copyright

The contents and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.‍

So far as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.

## Data protection

The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail address) is collected on our website, this is always done on a voluntary basis, as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.‍

We would like to point out that data transmission via the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.‍

We hereby object to the use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation for the purpose of sending advertising and information material not expressly requested. The operators of the website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, e.g. via spam e-mails.
