# Privacy Policy for the use of the Me App


###### (Version 1.2, March 2023)

The Me App ("Me" / "the App") is a product of the Me GbR (“We”/ “Us”). It offers you the opportunity to self-reflect on your life situation through journaling, tracking psychological metrics and completing self-reflection exercises. Additionally the self-reflection & personality development is fostered by psychoeducational learning content that is both provided by the Me GbR and third party content partners. The information that is gathered by that and by journaling is stored in your profile within the Me App. 

The privacy and security of your data is of high importance to us, which is why your journaling data is stored exclusively on your smartphone and is not accessible to us or third parties. 

All Data is collected, processed and stored in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 released on april 27th 2016 (“GDPR”).

The processing of your data serves exclusively the purpose of journaling and self-reflection. The Me App does not provide medical or psychotherapeutic consultation. It does not replace the consultation of a trained clinician or professional psychotherapist. Since the Me GbR does not give medical advice within the scope of the Me App it is not bound to medical confidentiality.

Your personal data, including the information that you enter into the Me App during journaling and completing self-reflection exercises, will be processed and stored encrypted and exclusively locally on your smartphone. It is not sent to a remote server.

This way your personal data can not be seen, analysed or shared by anyone except yourself or any other person that has access to your smartphone and holds your login credentials to the Me App. That is why you should make sure that your smartphone is not compromised in any way, including not providing root access to anyone (i.e. “jailbreaking”). Additionally you should not share your login credentials with anyone and store them at a secure location.

Entering any personal data into the app is voluntary and the legal basis for its data processing is your consent to our

* Consent to the Purpose & Limitations of the Me App

You can revoke those consents at any time with effect for the future in the "Settings" section of the app. Upon revocation or discontinuation of any of those consents, the right to use the Me App shall cease to exist.

You alone decide how long your data will be stored within the Me App. All locally processed and stored data can be permanently deleted by uninstalling the Me App from your smartphone or by revoking any of the consents listed above.
